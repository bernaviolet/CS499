## Self-Assessment
As I reflect on my journey through my Computer Science studies, I am proud of the diverse skills and knowledge I have gained. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages, including C#, HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB. Each language has expanded my technical toolkit and enhanced my ability to approach problems from multiple angles.
Strengths

One of my key strengths is my attention to detail. This skill has proven invaluable in debugging code and identifying program issues, allowing me to deliver high-quality work consistently. Additionally, my problem-solving abilities enable me to tackle complex challenges systematically, ensuring that I can devise effective solutions. I also excel in design, creating user-friendly interfaces and experiences that meet the needs of users.

My capacity for collaboration has significantly developed during my studies. Working in team environments has taught me the importance of communication and the value of diverse perspectives. I have actively engaged with my peers, contributing to discussions and projects that required strong teamwork. This experience has reinforced my belief that effective collaboration leads to better outcomes.

**Areas of Growth**

Throughout my studies, I have seen considerable growth in several areas:

**Collaborating in Team Environments:** I have participated in various group projects, where I learned to balance my contributions with those of my teammates. In one course, we worked through the SDLC in collaboration - different students in my group took on different areas of the project. Throughout that course, we faced challenges that we worked together to overcome. This experience taught me how to respect differing opinions and find common ground to achieve our goals.

**Communicating with Stakeholders:** I have gained experience in presenting technical information to non-technical stakeholders. In many of my courses, I prepared project presentations and summaries intended for non-technical audiences. From describing how a calculator application works to describing how machine learning grows in its knowledge, I have improved my ability to translate complex concepts into clear, understandable language, fostering better collaboration and project alignment.

**Data Structures and Algorithms:** My understanding of data structures and algorithms has deepened, enabling me to write more efficient and effective code. In my SQL course, I learned how to organize database tables effectively so that data is secure and easily accessible leading to better program functionality. I have enjoyed applying these concepts in practical projects and my current role as a Jr. Software Developer, optimizing performance and resource management.

**Software Engineering and Database Management:** I have developed a strong grasp of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and best practices in software engineering. Nearly every course built upon my knowledge of the SDLC. I have gained experience with agile and waterfall project methods. I have been able to employ those strategies in my current role as a Jr. Software Developer where I have had to use the agile methodology to iteratively work through programs to implement updates and I have also used the waterfall methodology to work with other team members to ensure that all project updates were implemented simultaneously for a very large project that effected many departments at my organization. My experience with databases, particularly SQL and MongoDB, has enhanced my ability to anticipate project needs and manage and manipulate data efficiently.

**Security Awareness:** Understanding the importance of security in software development has become a priority for me. I have learned about error handling, input validation, encryption, and SQL injection protection. Through studying these various security measures and best practices, it has allowed me to create applications that prioritize user safety and data protection.

**Conclusion**

In summary, my studies in Computer Science have equipped me with a robust set of skills and an appreciation for the importance of teamwork and communication. As I continue to grow, I am excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with diverse teams. I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to lifelong learning in the ever-evolving field of technology.

## Artifacts
###### Grazioso Service Animal Java to Python Migration
In this project, I successfully migrated a service animal application from Java to Python, showcasing my adaptability and proficiency in multiple programming languages. By implementing a reservation function, I enhanced the applicationâ€™s functionality, allowing users to reserve service animals seamlessly. Additionally, I incorporated robust error handling and input validation, demonstrating my commitment to producing reliable and user-friendly software. This project reflects my ability to build collaborative environments, as I consulted with peers to refine the application and ensure that it met diverse user needs. Furthermore, it exemplifies my capacity to design and deliver technically sound solutions that support effective decision-making in computer science.

###### Text-Based Game (Succulent City) Enhancements
In this project, I enhanced a text-based game by integrating relational database tables, significantly improving data management and game complexity. I developed a health function that offers users a health boost, creating a more dynamic gameplay experience. Additionally, I implemented an algorithm using random integers to determine the outcomes of battles against enemies over multiple rounds, rather than relying solely on object completion for victory. This project not only illustrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that address specific problems using algorithmic principles, but it also highlights my skill in managing trade-offs in design choices to enhance user engagement. My approach involved thorough testing and iteration, reinforcing my dedication to delivering high-quality, innovative computing solutions that align with industry standards.
